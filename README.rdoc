Some simple extensions to ExtJS 2.2.1 and 3.0.0

Currently implemented: 
* Ext.flatten(array) - flattens an array of sub-arrays into one array (2.x only)
* Ext.flattenTree(array) - flattens an array of Nodes with 'children' into one array of Nodes
* Ext.grid.PanelRowExpander - a RowExpander that renders a panel instead of a Template

ExtJS 2.2.1 and 3.0.0 are loaced in /ext2 and /ext3 dirs. Fully tested using ScrewUnit (located in /lib).
